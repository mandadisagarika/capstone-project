ISO 50001  
Energy management 
systems

Energy is critical to organizations, 
but often represents a significant 
cost – both to them and 
the environment. 
World energy consumption continues to rise : it has more than doubled 
in the last 40 years and is projected to increase a further 30 % by 2040 1). 
What’s more, energy is the major contributor to climate change, making 
up nearly 60 % of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Taking action to better manage our energy consumption not only 
helps the planet, it saves money for organizations and society as 
a whole. A study commissioned by the ClimateWorks Foundation, 
a non-governmental organization that leverages the power of collec-
tive philanthropy in the fight against climate change, showed that 
if more were done to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon 
growth in the industrial and buildings sectors alone, we could make 
over USD 3.2 trillion in public health-related savings 2). 
ISO 50001:2018, Energy management systems – Requirements with 
guidance for use, is a strategic tool that helps organizations put in 
place an energy management system and use their energy more 
efficiently and effectively.

What is an energy 
management system ?
An energy management system helps organi-
zations better manage their energy use, thus 
improving productivity. It involves developing 
and implementing an energy policy, setting 
achievable targets for energy use, and design-
ing action plans to reach them and measure 
progress. This might include implementing 
new energy-efficient technologies, reducing 
energy waste or improving current processes 
to cut energy costs.
ISO 50001 gives organizations a recognized 
framework for developing an effective energy 
management system. Like other ISO man-
agement system standards, it follows the 
“ Plan-Do-Check-Act ” process for continual 
improvement.
ISO 50001 provides a set of requirements that 
enable organizations to :
•	 Develop a policy for more efficient use of 
energy
•	 Fix targets and objectives to meet that policy
•	 Gather data to better understand and make 
decisions concerning energy use
•	 Measure the results obtained
•	 Review the effectiveness of the policy
•	 Continually improve energy management
What benefits will 
ISO 50001 bring  
to my business ?
ISO 50001 is designed to help your organiza-
tion improve its energy performance through 
making better use of its energy-intensive assets. 
Improved energy performance can provide rapid 
benefits for an organization by maximizing its 
use of energy sources and energy-related assets, 
reducing both cost and consumption.
ISO 50001 is used by large and small organiza-
tions all over the world. Its benefits can take many 
forms. For some, it is about reducing the envi-
ronmental impact and enhancing reputation; for 
others, the aim is to drive down costs and improve 
competitiveness.

“ISO 50001 has really helped 
us to ensure we are following a 
consistent approach to energy 
management across all our 
properties. Since implementing 
the standard, energy management 
has remained a key focus for our 
leadership and we continue to 
seek opportunities to drive our 
performance to the next level.”

of Corporate Responsibility  
& ADA Compliance at Hilton

ISO 50001 in action
Following are a couple of success stories of 
organizations using ISO 50001 :
Hilton
One of the world’s largest hotel chains, Hilton 
was the first global hospitality company 
to achieve portfolio-wide certification to 
ISO 50001 following a comprehensive upgrade 
to its corporate responsibility performance 
measurement platform. The savings have 
been significant, reducing Hilton’s energy 
intensity by 20.6 % and its carbon intensity 
by 30.0 % from a 2008 baseline.
An Garda Síochána
An Garda Síochána (AGS) is the 
national police force of Ireland 
with over 16 000 employees. When 
the Irish government announced 
its ambitious target of improving 
energy efficiency by 33 % for the 
public sector by 2020, AGS imple-
mented a robust energy manage-
ment system and received ISO 50001 
certification. 
Since starting the project in 2009, 
AGS has saved USD 11 307 142 through 
reduced energy use and energy effi-
ciency is now considered in everyday 
policing operations. 
More examples of ISO 50001 
in action can be found at the 
Clean Energy Ministerial, a high-
level international forum promoting 
policies that advance the world’s 
transition to clean energy.
“ An Garda Síochána are the first national 
police force in the world to achieve 
ISO 50001 certification, achieving energy 
savings of 21.9 % and energy cost savings 
of 9.3 % since 2009.”
Mike Dodd, Management Representative, 
ISO 50001 Energy Team, An Garda Síochána

Who is ISO 50001 for ?
Like all ISO management system standards, ISO 50001 has been 
designed for implementation by any organization in the public or 
private sector, whatever its size, activity or geographical location.
ISO 50001 does not fix targets for improving energy performance, 
which is left up to the user organization or regulatory authorities. This 
means that any organization, regardless of its current level of energy 
performance, can implement ISO 50001 to establish a baseline and 
improve on it at its own rate.
What about 
certification ?
Like all ISO management system standards, ISO 50001 
can be implemented solely for the internal and exter-
nal benefits it provides to the organization itself, its 
stakeholders and its customers. Certification to the 
standard by an independent auditor is not a require-
ment of ISO 50001. To certify or not is a decision to 
be taken by the organization, unless imposed by 
regulation. 
Why was ISO 50001 
revised ?
Like all ISO standards, ISO 50001 is reviewed every 
five years to ensure it is up to date with market 
requirements. One of the main reasons for updating 
ISO 50001 was to align it with ISO’s requirements for 
management system standards, including its High-
Level Structure (HLS), a framework designed to facili-
tate the integration of new management topics into 
an organization’s established management systems.
Other key changes compared to the previous edition 
include stronger emphasis on the role of senior man-
agement, updates to terms and definitions as well as 
the normalization and clarification of energy perfor-
mance indicator (EnPI) and energy baseline (EnB) text 
to provide a better understanding of these concepts.
